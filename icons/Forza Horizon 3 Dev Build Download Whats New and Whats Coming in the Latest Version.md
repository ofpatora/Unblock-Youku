## Step 1: Uninstall Forza Horizon 3
 
The first step is to uninstall Forza Horizon 3 from your PC. This is because the developer version will overwrite some files and settings of the official version, and you may encounter some errors or conflicts if you keep both versions on your PC. However, if you really want to have both versions, you can try to install them on different drives or partitions, but this is not covered in this tutorial.
 
To uninstall Forza Horizon 3, go to Settings > Apps > Apps & features on your PC. Find Forza Horizon 3 in the list and click on it. Then click on Uninstall and follow the instructions.
 
## Step 2: Disable Anti-Virus and Enable Developer Mode
 
The next step is to disable your anti-virus software and enable developer mode on your PC. This is because some anti-virus programs may detect the developer version files as malware and block them from running. And developer mode is required to run some commands and scripts that are needed for the installation.
 
To disable your anti-virus software, open it and look for an option to turn it off temporarily or add an exception for the folder where you will download and extract the developer version files.
 
To enable developer mode, go to Settings > Update & Security > For developers on your PC. Under Use developer features, select Developer mode and click on Yes when prompted.
 
## Step 3: Download and Extract the Developer Version Files
 
The third step is to download and extract the developer version files using a torrent client. The files are about 60 GB in size and include the base game, the update, and the Blizzard Mountain expansion.
 
To download the files, go to https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=70576&start=4050#p1509779[^3^] and find a link that says "Forza Horizon 3 - Ultimate All-in-One Update". Click on it and open it with your torrent client. Then choose a folder where you want to save the files and start downloading.
 
To extract the files, open the folder where you saved them and find a file that says "Forza.Horizon.3.Ult
