But what is Chew7 1.2 and how does it work? Is it safe to use and does it really activate Windows 7? In this article, we will answer these questions and more.
 
## What is Chew7 1.2?
 
Chew7 1.2 is a program that was created by a group of hackers known as The Hazardous Team. It was released in 2010 and has been updated several times since then. The latest version is Chew7 1.2 Build 0.0.6.5.
 
Chew7 1.2 is designed to modify the system files and registry entries of Windows 7 to make it appear as if it has passed the online validation process. It also disables the WAT service that checks for activation status and blocks updates that may detect and remove the activation hack.
 
Chew7 1.2 supports all editions of Windows 7, including Home Premium, Professional, Ultimate, Enterprise, and Starter. It also works with both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows 7.
 
## How does Chew7 1.2 work?
 
Chew7 1.2 works by injecting a DLL file called chew-wga.dll into the system32 folder of Windows 7. This file contains code that mimics the behavior of the genuine Microsoft software licensing service (sppsvc.exe). It also creates a fake certificate and product key that match the edition of Windows 7 installed on the computer.
 
When Windows 7 tries to verify its activation status, it contacts the chew-wga.dll file instead of the sppsvc.exe file. The chew-wga.dll file then returns a positive response, indicating that Windows 7 is activated and genuine.
 
Chew7 1.2 also modifies the boot sector of the hard drive to load the chew-wga.dll file before Windows 7 starts up. This ensures that the activation hack is always active and cannot be detected or removed by Windows updates or antivirus programs.
 
## Is Chew7 1.2 safe to use?
 
Chew7 1.2 is not safe to use for several reasons. First of all, it is illegal to use software that violates the terms and conditions of Microsoft's license agreement. By using Chew7 1.2, you are committing software piracy and may face legal consequences.

Secondly, Chew7 1.2 may harm your computer and compromise your security. Since it modifies system files and registry entries, it may cause instability, errors, or crashes on your Windows 7 system. It may also prevent you from receiving important security updates that protect your computer from viruses, malware, and hackers.
 
Thirdly, Chew7 1.2 may contain malicious code that can steal your personal information, damage your files, or infect your computer with other malware. Some versions of Chew7 1.2 have been reported to contain trojans, worms, keyloggers, rootkits, and ransomware.
 
## Does Chew7 1.2 really activate Windows 7?
 
Chew7 1.2 does not really activate Windows 7 in the sense that it does not provide you with a legitimate license key or certificate from Microsoft. It only tricks Windows 7 into thinking that it is activated and genuine by using a fake DLL file and a fake product key.
 
This means that Chew7 1.2 can be detected and removed by Microsoft at any time if they update their WAT service or release a new patch that checks for activation hacks. If this happens, your Windows 7 will revert to its original state and display a message saying that it is not genuine.
 
This also means that Chew7 1.2 does not guarantee that you can access all the features and benefits of a genuine Windows 7 system. For example, you may not be able to use certain online services such as Windows Update, Microsoft Security Essentials
